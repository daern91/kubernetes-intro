Exercise: Run a load test, `ab -n 25 -c 5 localhost:8080/` and write down the tests time to finish. Then reference the [kubectl cheat sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) and scale up so we have 5 running pods. Run the load test again and check if there is a difference in the tests time to finish.

Finish up by scaling down to 1 pod again.
